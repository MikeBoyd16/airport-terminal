JTDS Required



Getting the PDXServices java program to work properly requires 4 steps.

Step 1: Open up SQL Server Management Studio and attach the PDX database provided.

Step 2: Upon starting Netbeans and opening this program, place the .jar file from the JTDS folder in the class path when prompted.

Step 3: Right click on the program name -> Select properties -> Run -> VM Options -> Change which drive is shown in the file path (D, E, F, etc.) to the
one associated with this flash drive.

Step 4: In the SQLQueries Class, modify the url variable in the establishConnection() method to match the PC name of whatever computer you're connecting from.

	String url ="jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://PCNAME/PDX;instance=MSSQLSERVER";



If it still doesn't work, go back to VM options and change the portion "x86" to "x64"
